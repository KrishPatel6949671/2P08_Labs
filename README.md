# PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT 01: ARRAYS

 

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. Arrays are the most used data structure for many reasons. First, we look at the basics of how data is inserted, searched, and deleted from arrays.  Then, we look how the data can be stored in ascending key order. This arrangement makes possible a fast way of searching for a data item: the binary search.

 

##Exercises:

 

1. Implement a function that iterates through the array and prints every time in the array.
 

2. Implement a function that returns number of items in the array.
 

3. Implement a function that returns the value at index n.
 

4. Implement a function that replaces an item at index n and return the array. The function returns -1 if the index is out of range (i.e., larger than the size of the array)
 

5. Implement a function that adds an item at the end of the list. Do not use any python built-in function e.g., append.
 

6. Implement a function that adds an item at index n and return the array. Please note that if n is larger than the size of the array, then the function will insert the item at the end of the array. Do not use any python array built-in function e.g., insert.
 

7. Implement a function that returns the index of the (first) element with the specified value. It returns -1 if the value was not found. Do not use any python built-in function e.g., index.
 

8. Implement a function that deletes the first item with the specified value, and returns the array if value was found and deleted, -1 otherwise. Do not use any python built-in function.
 

9. Implement a function that removes the element at the specified position. Default position value is -1, which returns the last item. The function returns removed value. Do not use any python built-in function.
 

10. Implement the bubble sort and selection sort functions that sorts the list in ascending order.
 

11. You are asked to improve the find function of Exercise 7. Assuming the array is sorted, implement binary search to returns the index of the (first) element with the specified value. The function returns -1 if the value was not found.
